# Project Overview

**JC-REACT-BOILERPLATE** is a template you can use when starting a React Application.
The template itself was structured based on the most commonly used libraries and architecture when developing React Application.
You can opt to use this template if you feel ReactJS [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) is too complicated for your project.

## Structure

This boilerplate uses the following technologies:

1.  [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
2.  [ReactHooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
3.  [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
4.  [Redux-Typescript](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide)
5.  [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
6.  [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
7.  **HTML/SCSS**
8.  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
